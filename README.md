## Description
The new type of HAN!
<br>
We wanted a new type of mod that look like it was part of the system and totally offline. So, we created (R)Evolution.
<br>
(R)Evolution is an XMB Mod that makes HAN to feel like its part of the system.
<br>
We also aim to provide the full support for homebrew apps and homebrew games on the PS3 System for new developers to come and develop new apps and games.
